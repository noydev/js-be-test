# Design database for sneaker reselling website

## Sneaker and price

First we we will create a **product** and _sneaker_size_ table as below

- The relationship is one (product) to many (sneaker_size)
- The most likely scenario is from to query _product_ left join _sneaker_size_ to get an item and all it corresponding size/price
- Can also query thing like available sneakers with size this a given size.

```sql
CREATE TABLE product (
	id serial,
	product_name VARCHAR ( 100 ) NOT NULL,
	color VARCHAR ( 20 ) NOT NULL,
	brand VARCHAR ( 100 ) NOT NULL,
	created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE sneaker_size (
    id serial,
    size_no VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    default_price REAL NOT NULL,
    product_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
    CONSTRAINT fk_product_id FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES product (id)
)
```

An enhancement that I see fit here is that we create a composite index of _size_ and _gender_ these two properties make a meaning full pair size-gender that would be very like queried together.

```sql
CREATE INDEX size_gender ON sneaker_size (size_no, gender);
```

## Demand and supply

_My first assumption_

About demand and supply. As our application grows big, I think the business of managing order and the business of managing inventory become very serious, it'd be very reasonable that these both deserve a stand alone kind of service or third party one just to deal with thier logic. Which means the state of _number of successful order over an item_ as well as _the real number of item left in the inventory_ can only be updated via network request.

In this case. I would like to have a table to store the state of these in the same database with **product** table. And update it via network request. It serves only price caculating in backend as well as displaying in frontend and app and can tolerate some level of data unconsistency.

```sql
CREATE TABLE demand (
    size_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    successful_order INTEGER,
    inventory INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (size_id)
    CONSTRAINT fk_size_id FOREIGN KEY (size_id) REFERENCES sneaker_size (id)
)
```

## Promotion

Next thing is about promotion. In my opinion promotion deserved it own domain of logic. With a lot of thing to be considered such condition, coupon, discount and other stuffs. For the context of this exercise, I will stick with a basic promotion campaign

```sql
CREATE TABLE promotion (
    id serial,
    discount_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    amount REAL NOT NULL,
    time_start TIMESTAMP,
    time_end TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE promotion_product (
    id serial,
    product_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    promotion_id  VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
     CONSTRAINT fk_product_id FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES product (id)
      CONSTRAINT fk_promotion_id FOREIGN KEY (promotion_id) REFERENCES promotion (id)
)
```

The backend will be responsible for querying for default price and then calculate the final based on defined logic.

## Overview

Our general structure will look like this.
